# Project Overview

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
It was conceived to act as my personal blog and it is meant to host tech related articles and tutorials. It also contains an "Introduction" and a "Contact" section. The app uses React and React Router for its functionality, and SASS as a preprocessor. Finally, it uses CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid layout model to style its sections and elements. 

## How to run the app

To get started: 

+ clone the project using Git or download it as a .zip file
+ Open the terminal and cd into the project folder
+ install all the project dependencies using the `npm install` command
+ start the development server using the `npm start` command

Alternatively, you can view the live version here (hosted by Netlify): [Live Demo](https://kind-meitner-c1bd4d.netlify.com/#/)

### Application Structure

The app relies on React Router to create a single page application. Since the application doesn't require a dynamic server, I opted for a `<HashRouter>` solution.
